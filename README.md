# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

## Purpose

The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary dataframe for ride sharing data by city type and show the total weekly fares for each city type. This is important because we can use the new dataframe to display which city type has the most or least amount of fares each week. 

## Results

### Data Summary

The data summary breaks down how many rides and drivers are in each city too and this shows that Urban areas have more rides and drivers compared to rural areas and the suburbs. 

### Dataframe

The results show that overall the city type (Urban) has the highest fares each week and this indicates more people are using ride sharing in urban area and more drivers are avaiable in urban areas versus in rural areas and in suburbs. The results also show that rural has the lowest fares each week and this indicates that less inidividuals are using ride sharing apps and less drivers are avaiable in rural areas.

### Line PLot

The line plot above shows the city types and the sum of fares over the course of a couple months from January to April and this shows that Urban areas have the most amoutn of fares and rural has the least amount. Also, all three areas show that fares increase around mid to the end of Feburaray. All three types also have pretty low fares in January, which my indicate that cold weather deters individuals from going out and using ride sharing apps. 

### Summary

1. Try to use some funding to having more drivers in rural areas and maybe have some deals for riders in rural area, so more people use the app more often.
2. During holidays you can always increase the fares slighlty in all areas, becuase on days like New Years more people are goign to want to use the apps to go out. 
3. Try switching drivers to other areas occasionally, that way if there is a driver not making much in one area, they can go to a more urban area where there are more people using the drive sharing app.
