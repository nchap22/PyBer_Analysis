# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

### Purpose
The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary dataframe for ride sharing data by city type and show the total weekly fares for each city type. This is important because we can use the new dataframe to display which city type has the most or least amount of fares each week. 

### Results

The results show that overall the city type (Urban) has the highest fares each week and this indicates more people are using ride sharing in urban area and more drivers are avaiable in urban areas versus in rural areas and in suburbs. The results also show that rural has the lowest fares each week and this indicates that less inidividuals are using ride sharing apps and less drivers are avaiable in rural areas.
